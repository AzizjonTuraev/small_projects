Here, I created a Python script which interacts with 'https://www.netztransparenz.de/Daten-zur-Regelenergie/reBAP/reBAP' website, enters inputs and gives command to download data from this website. 

Ps. 
- The code is very specific to the website. 
- If there is any change in webpage HTML code, then this Python script have to be updated otherwise it does not work
